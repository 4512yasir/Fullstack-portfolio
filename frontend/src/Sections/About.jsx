          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>
            I'm <strong>Yaska</strong> ‚Äî a creative and analytical thinker driven by a deep passion for software engineering and design. I love turning ideas into elegant solutions that solve real-world problems.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a strong foundation in <strong>Frontend and Backend development</strong>, I enjoy building applications using tools like <strong>React, Flask, SQL, and Python</strong>. My approach blends performance with usability, ensuring every product I build is fast, intuitive, and scalable.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a <strong>Graphic and UI/UX Designer</strong>, I have a natural eye for layout, spacing, color, and detail. I believe great design should not just look good ‚Äî it should feel effortless and guide the user‚Äôs journey.
          </p>

          <h3>My Mission</h3>
          <p>
            To empower people, communities, and businesses by building thoughtful digital tools that make life easier, more connected, and more efficient.
          </p>

          <h3>How I Work</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>üß† I think in systems and design for scalability.</li>
            <li>ü§ù I value collaboration, empathy, and lifelong learning.</li>
            <li>üöÄ I strive for excellence, not just functionality.</li>
            <li>üß™ I believe in rapid prototyping and feedback loops.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
          <p>
            When I‚Äôm not coding or designing, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, sketching UI ideas, watching documentaries, and collaborating on open-source ideas. I'm curious by nature and love connecting with like-minded builders.
